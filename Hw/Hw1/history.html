                    The History of Biometrics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Biometrics have been used for thousands of years to authenticate the identity of a person. <br />
                    There have been traces found throughout history. During the reign of the Babylonian empire <br />
                    ranging from 2300 B.C. - 539 B.C.,Babylonians used fingerprints on clay tablets for <br />
                    business transactions. 
                </p>
                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
                <p>
                    In ancient China, biometrics was useful in that it maintained law and order due to the large population. <br />
                    During the Qin and Han Dynasties in years 206 B.C.-589 C.E, fingerprints would be used as an identifier. <br />
                    The Qin Dynasty used fingerprints for important documents to keep them secure. They used a clay seal <br />
                    with a monogram on one side and a fingerprint on the other.
