                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the process of using a person's physical characteristics in order to
                    determine if they <br />are who they say they are. The use of biometric technologies
                    have been utilized as a way <br />for every person to have a unique identification.
                    A number of biometric traits are used <br />such as the fingerprint, iris scan, facial 
                    recognition, voice recognition, etc. Many large <br />corporations use it for things such as: <br />
