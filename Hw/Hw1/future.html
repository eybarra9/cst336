                    The Future of Biometrics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Biometric technology is something that will continue to be controversial mainly <br />
                    because of the risks one is taking on using this as a form of identification or <br />
                    authentication. This idea still needs work as hackers are still able to bypass <br />
                    security. An example of this is how some biometric technologies such as the <br />
                    fingerprint scan can be fooled. In an article by Tony Anscombe’s states,
                </p>
                    <blockquote cite = "https://www.scmagazineuk.com/biometrics-or-a-password/article/531571/" >
                        “In 2014 the chaos computer club replicated the fingerprint of German Defence Minister, <br />
                        Ursula von der Leyen. Through high definition digital photography and specialized <br />
                        software they recreated a digital print that potentially could be used to fool <br />
                        fingerprint-based biometric security systems” (Anscombe, 2016).

                        Hackers will always find ways to make a detour and infiltrate the system of any user.<br />
                    </p>

                    Don't get me wrong biometric authentication has great benefits to society. The majority <br />
                    of smartphones today have some form of biometric authentication such as the fingerprint <br />
                    for Iphone 8 and Google Pixel, facial recognition for the Iphone X. Even companies such as <br />
                    Tesla are implementing this technology to their cars. There is no doubt that this will continue <br />
                    to develop and improve in order to produce a more secure way to authenticate identities.
