                    Biometrics have come a long way since the ancient era of human civilization. <br />
                    Recent trends today include: <br />
                </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li><span class ="trends">Ear</span>: Identification by the shape of the ear</li>
                            <li><span class ="trends">Eyes(Iris)</span>: The use of eyes to identify the person</li>
                            <li><span class ="trends">Face</span>: Analysis of facial features and patterns to authenticate</li>
                            <li><span class ="trends">Fingerprint</span>: The ridges of fingers are unique to each person</li>
                            <li><span class ="trends">Typing</span>: The unique patterns found of a person's typing behavior</li>
                            <li><span class ="trends">Voice</span>: Unique pitch, frequency, and tone of voice to authenticate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        All of these have been some of the ways corporations have used biometrics and <br />
                        have implemented them to modern technology such as a fingerprint scanner on a mobile <br />
                        device. Even more recently is behavior biometrics. An example is keystroke dynamics where <br />
                        the rhythm in which an indivdual types on a keyboard is used to authenticate an identity.
